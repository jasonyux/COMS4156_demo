This repo contain (really quick) quickstarts for how to containerize your frontend/backend/database! See the respective folders for more details:

- `springboot/`: containerize your `springboot` project in 4 steps!
- `nodejs/`: containerize your `nodejs` project in 4 steps!
- `database/`: containerize your `mysql`/`redis` in ..., quite some steps in this case

Note that this demo extensively uses:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

So as a **prerequisite**, you will need to have installed `docker` and have a `docker hub` account (it's free):
